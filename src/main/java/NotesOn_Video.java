        - his name on github is RainbowCoder
        - and Shiffman

      Best for Version Control and Collaboration

      Git   &   Center   &  GitHub
       - Git is a Version Control Software
          - this is the actual application
        - GitHub is a webservice tht uses github and vice versa
         - its a website that has projects and you can do version control on them
       - if you want u could only use git and never git hub but u could also only use github and never use git anywhere else


       Repository or "Repo"
         -  a repo for files
         - holds your commits

       Made a Txt File in GitHub (didnt knw could do tht)
        - rainbow poem

       Commit is a save
        - i am going to change the file and make a commit
        - You can edit files directly in the gitHUB!
        - u can look at the history of your commits if u click history
        - there's something called a Commit hash
        - its a unique identifier for THAT commit


        BRANCH:
         - u can branch off where u can experiment
         - first initial is named Master branch
         - u can add branches that branch themselves till its like a tree
         - u select the branch: master  button and create a new branch
         and commit to the unicorn branch
          - graphs button is now the Insights button then u click network


        PULL REQUEST and MERGE
         - Will u please take my branch and add it to master
         take some changes from a particular branch and bring them into another branch
         - git checks for if it can merge
         - u only get a problem if uve edited a line already there
         - u can add a new branch and then change the master at same time// and then
         merge said commits into one even tho the masters ahead of the branch now
         - EXPERIMENT LATER

        FORK AND PULL REQUEST
         - U can fork someone elses code (no initial or known things)
         - if you do that then u dont have to worry about  affecting someone elses code?
         - PULL REQUEST wanting to contribute this code to the other persons pull request which will then
         accepted or rejected
         - sending out code is PUSHING
         - taking in code is PULLING
         - i as JOJO want to push my code to ZEE and see if he will PULL it in

        -- SIMPLE WAY: open someones project and click edit file (will automatically fork since u don't have permission)
          - another is fork button

        STARTED ZEE COMMIT FOR DRAGONS
